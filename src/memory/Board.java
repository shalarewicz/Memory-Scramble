/**
 * 
 * Mutable and threadsafe type used to play a game of memory scramble. Each board can be played by a {@link #Player} identified by a unique id. 
 * A board has rows * columns spots which can either be empty or filled by a {@link #Card}
 * 
 * A game of Memory Scramble obeys the following rules:
 * Multiple players manipulate the cards on the board concurrently. They play the game by trying to turn over pairs of identical cards. Hereï¿½s an informal summary of the rules:
 * 
 *	1. When a player turns over a first card in a pair, they control that card. If someone else already controls it, they block until they can take control.
 *	2. When the player turns over a second card, if the cards match, the player keeps control of them; otherwise, the player gives up control. The cards stay face up for now.
 *	3. When the player makes their next move, if their previous cards matched, those cards are removed from the board; otherwise, if no one controls them, they turn face down.
 * 
 * Spaces on the board are numbered such that (1, 1) refers the space in the upper left hand corner. 
 * 
 * <p>PS4 instructions: the specifications of static methods
 * {@link #parseFromFile(String)} and {@link #generateRandom(int, int, Set)} are
 * required.
